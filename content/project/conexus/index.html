<p>For <a href="https://www.conexus.net/">Conexus</a> I work as an external advisor on one of their
products - the Entrepreneurship Mindset Tool. This instrument is a game-based assessment
used to measure entrepreneurial skills from the European EntreComp Framework. This
assessment will be mainly deployed in three African countries: Uganda, Tanzania and
South-Sudan.</p>
