<p>This website has been created using RStudio, specifically the Blogdown package, that
can be installed in R using the following piece of code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The package can be loaded in the RStudio global environment by using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(blogdown)</code></pre>
<p>The nice thing about building websites in R is that the text can be made up in Mmarkdown,
which allows you to present code, as seen above. You can also give commments with the code,
like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>1 + 1 # executed</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note that there are two types of Markdown. The regular Markdown does not
allow any execution of code, while R Markdown does allow execution of code. For example,
this post has been written in R Markdown, and therefore 1 + 1 will be calculated.
Based on what you want to display on the website, it is important to decide which type
of Markdown to use.</p>
