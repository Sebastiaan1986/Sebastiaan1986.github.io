abstract: "Technological advancements continue to drive innovation in CBA.
Presently, test developers already incorporate multimedia elements into their
CBAs (de Klerk, 2012). Educational institutions are designing technologybased
assessments and items in a growing rate (Bennett, 2002). These
assessments simulate a highly contextualized environment and students are
confronted with tasks that they could encounter in real life (Issenberg,
Gordon, Gordon, Safford, & Hart, 2001; Ziv, Small, & Wolpe, 2000). The
general rationale behind innovative assessments is that they provide more
meaningful observations about student skills than traditional multiple-choice
tests or performance-based assessment (PBA). For example, research has
shown that immersive environments are capable of capturing observations
that is not possible to capture in a conventional classroom setting (Clarke,
2009; Ketelhut, Dede, Clarke, Nelson & Bowman, 2008). In scientific
literature, multimedia and even immersive virtual reality possibilities are
being discussed in relation to assessment (Susi, Johanneson, & Backlund,
2007; Sliney & Murphy, 2011; Clarke-Midura & Dede, 2010). Thus,
technological progress provides opportunities for the design and development
of innovative and interactive technology-based assessments. However,
technological advancement in assessment is ahead of research and
psychometrics."
