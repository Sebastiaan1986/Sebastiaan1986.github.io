abstract: "In this article, a case study on the design, development, and evaluationof a multimedia-based performance assessment (MBPA) for measuring confinedspace guards’ skills is presented. A confined space guard (CSG) supervises oper‐ations  that  are  carried  out  in  a  confined  space  (e.g.  a  tank  or  silo).  Currently,individuals  who  want  to  become  a  certified  CSG  in  The  Netherlands  have  toparticipate  in  a  one  day  training  program  and  have  to  pass  both  a  knowledge-based MC test and a practice-based performance-based assessment (PBA). Ourgoal is to measure the skills that are currently being assessed through the PBA,with  the  MBPA.  We  first  discuss  the  design  and  development  of  the  MBPA.Secondly, we present an empirical study which was used for assessing the qualityof  our  measurement  instrument.  A  representative  sample  of  55  CSG  students,who  had  just  completed  the  one  day  training  program,  has  subsequentlyperformed  in  the  MC  test,  and  then,  depending  on  the  condition  they  wereassigned, the PBA or the MBPA. We report the psychometric properties of theMBPA.  Furthermore,  using  correlations  and  regression  analysis,  we  make  anempirical comparison between students’ scores on the PBA and the MBPA. Theresults show that students’ scores on the PBA and the MBPA are significantlycorrelated and that students’ MBPA score is a good predictor for their score onthe  PBA.  In  the  discussion,  we  provide  implications  and  directions  for  futureresearch and practice into the field of MBPA."
