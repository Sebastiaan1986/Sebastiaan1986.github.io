abstract: "Computer-based simulations are increasingly being used in educational assessment. In most cases, the
simulation-based assessment (SBA) is used for formative assessment, which can be defined as assessment
for learning, but as research on the topic continues to grow, possibilities for summative assessment,
which can be defined as assessment of learning, are also emerging. The current study contributes to
research on the latter category of assessment. In this article, we present a methodology for scoring the
interactive and complex behavior of students in a specific type of SBA, namely, a Multimedia-based
Performance Assessment (MBPA), which is used for a summative assessment purpose. The MBPA is
used to assess the knowledge, skills, and abilities of confined space guard (CSG) students. A CSG supervises
operations that are carried out in a confined space (e.g., a tank or silo). We address two specific
challenges in this article: the evidence identification challenge (i.e., scoring interactive task performance),
and the evidence accumulation challenge (i.e., accumulating scores in a psychometric model). Using expert
ratings on the essence and difficulty of actions in the MBPA, we answer the first challenge by demonstrating
that interactive task performance in MBPA can be scored. Furthermore, we answer the second
challenge by recoding the expert ratings in conditional probability tables that can be used in a Bayesian
Network (a psychometric model for reasoning under uncertainty and complexity). Finally, we validate
and illustrate the presented methodology through the analysis of the response data of 57 confined space
guard students who performed in the MBPA."
