abstract: "Serious games are increasingly being explored for use as assessment tools in broad domains. Drawing from research in these domains, we present important advantages and challenges that arise when using games for assessment. In light of this context and as an introduction to this special issue on Serious Games and Assessments, we introduce the expertsâ€™ contributions on using games for processes integrating agile game development approaches with psychometric validation processes and designing and developing games for formative assessments."
