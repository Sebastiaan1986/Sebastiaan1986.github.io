abstract: "Driven by the technological revolution, computer-based testing (CBT) has witnessed an explosive rise the last decades, in both psychological and educational assessment. Many paperand-pencil tests now have a computer-based equivalent. Innovations in CBT are almost innumerable, and innovative and new CBTs continue to emerge on a very regular basis. Innovations in CBT may best be described along a continuum of several dimensions. Parshall, Spray, Kalohn, and Davey (2002) describe five innovation dimensions in which CBTs can differ in their level of innovativeness: item format, response action, media inclusion, level of interactivity, and scoring method. This chapter provides a detailed description of the five innovation dimensions, including case examples. Furthermore, an overview of opportunities, risks, and future research will be given."
